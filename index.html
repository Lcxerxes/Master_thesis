        <h2>Introduction to the Thesis</h2>
        <p>This is a brief overview of my thesis made with chatgpt with some comments made by me, the rest will be exclusively written by me. You can read the full thing below if you want, nobudy is forcing you.</p>
        <h3>Purpose of the Thesis:</h3>
        <p>
            Introduction
            The purpose of this thesis is to reflect upon my journey as a Multimedia composer (me: This is a bit dramatic) during my master’s program, culminating in my final concert. This reflection not only serves to analyze the artistic and technical aspects of my work but also to articulate the personal and professional growth I have experienced. By examining the pieces performed in my final concert and other significant works created during my studies, I aim to provide a comprehensive overview of my development as a composer.
            This thesis is structured into several sections. It begins with a discussion of my academic journey and the influences that have shaped my work. Following this, I will provide an overview of my early projects, highlighting how my style and techniques have evolved. The core of this thesis focuses on an in-depth (me: well, in-depth I don't know.. ) analysis of the pieces presented in my final concert, exploring the compositional techniques employed, the creative processes involved, and the impact of collaborations. Finally, a critical reflection section will address the strengths and challenges of my work, incorporating feedback from mentors and audiences.

        <h2>August 30, 2024 - Back in Hamburg</h2>
        <p>
            I’m currently back in Hamburg and have been working since I returned. Today is August 30th, and I will start a new version of the thesis. I also helped two friends today, Diego Muhr and Gabriela Perez, with their move. Actually, I arrived 50 minutes late, and everything was done by the time I got there, so maybe it’s not fair to say I helped them. But at least we had the chance to hang out before they left. I’ll be moving out of Hamburg soon.
        </p>

        <h3>The Thesis</h3>
        <p>
            This thesis is going to be about me… I’ll try to write about what I think will be useful for me, and hopefully, I’ll manage to say something meaningful.
        </p>

        <p>
            I had an idea on how to start, but I just forgot. I think I need to stop the music I’m listening to, which is a pity because I’m enjoying it a lot. I’m not sure if the silence will help me, but I can't focus on both tasks at the same time. When I'm listening to music, most of my brainpower is trying to understand what’s happening there. In fact, I might lose the flow, but I’ll let the song finish....................................................................................................................................
        </p>

        <p>
            The number of dots here represents how long the song took to end. Well, I didn’t start pressing the key immediately, or there would be more dots. Let me check something in my keyboard settings.
        </p>
        <img src="Screenshot 2024-08-30 at 15.23.27.png" alt="My keyboard settings" width="500">

        <p>
            Well, it didn’t help much. I also wasted some time trying to find a screenshot and close all the unnecessary Finder windows. I had to log out and in again from Max to authorize it, etc. Since I started this thesis, I’ve already lost around five minutes. Anyway...
        </p>

        <p>
            This is my creative process: trying to do something and constantly getting distracted by other stuff.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Well, that’s it.</strong> Thank you for reading my thesis!</p>

        <p>
            I wish I could end it like that, but I need my degree.
        </p>

        <h2>Making Do with What You Have</h2>
        <p>
            Okay, I had to rewrite this part because it was too long, and I wasn’t sure if it was useful.
            <p>

        <p>
            In short, I’ve always worked with limited resources, so I had to learn how to teach myself and improvise a lot. </p>
        <p>
            I think the key message here is that my mindset has always been to make the most of whatever is available to me.</p>
        <p>    
            I mostly use free resources I find online. I bought Ableton with a student discount, and recently, after ten years, I finally bought a new computer. Now, I have more than enough to do a lot of what I want.</p> <p> I'm really grateful for all the free and open-source tools out there. Occasionally, I buy Max for Live devices, but mostly as a way to support other artists who share their interesting ideas.
        </p>    
             

        <h2>The Impact of Studying in Hamburg</h2>
        <p>
            Studying in Hamburg has been incredibly important for me. During my master’s, I had the chance to work on many projects, often collaborating with Alicia S. Reyes. Honestly, I don’t know if I would have made it without her. She invited me to participate in her projects or collaborate on new ones. When I work with someone else, I get so worried about letting them down that I can't rest until I do my part. These collaborations have been crucial in motivating me, and they’ve even inspired me to work on my own pieces.
        </p>

        <p>
            I used every opportunity to learn something new, and I took lessons as inspiration. To be honest, most of the learning happened at home, in front of my computer or the equipment I was using.
        </p>

        <p>
            Professor Jacob Seilo also helped a lot. He was always available to assist students, and his troubleshooting sessions wouldn’t end until the problem was solved. He saved the day more than once.
        </p>

        <h3>Semester Abroad in Tallinn</h3>
        <p>
            During my master’s, I spent a semester abroad in Tallinn doing an internship, and I’m glad I did. It gave me time to explore ideas and participate in projects without the pressure of attending lessons. One of the great things about the master’s program is the variety of classes and topics you can explore, but it can also be overwhelming, especially if you have to work to make a living. This happened to me during the second semester, and I had to stop attending most of the classes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fortunately, when I returned, I got a job as a student assistant. While it didn’t pay much, I gained access to all the department's equipment. I could easily go into a room and try things out. I ended up spending most of my time around school, returning home late with little energy, but I learned a lot—especially during the multimedia concerts, which were organized entirely by students. Since I was in charge of the equipment, I worked more than my colleagues, but it was all valuable experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Final Reflections</h3>
        <p>
            My approach has always been to make something out of smaller, random parts to solve problems, and I’m getting better at it. I try to come up with quick solutions as problems arise, which happens often in the context of student multimedia projects. I’ve also tried to be as available as possible to help my colleagues, except in my final semester when I had to focus on my final concert. I didn’t have the mental power to be around as much as before. Many aspects of my work might have been invisible, but that’s okay because I was also preparing myself for real-world scenarios.
        </p>

        <p>
            A very important thing I’ve gained from studying here is confidence. I’m far more confident now and less afraid of being on stage or speaking in public. I just need to be sure I’m prepared. I avoided doing these kinds of things my entire life, but here I had no choice—I had to do it. At first, it felt like someone was stabbing me in the stomach, but eventually, I got used to it.
        </p>

        <p>
            More than the degree itself, what’s truly important for me is that I’ve learned and grown to the best of my ability. Maybe I could have done more, and there were topics I wanted to explore further, but honestly, I can still explore them.
        </p>
        
   


    
            <h2>Projects</h2>
    
        <p>
            I have taken part in several projects since I moved to Hamburg, almost 100% more projects than I had in Portugal. One of the main reasons I came to the Multimedia Composition department was to learn Max. I wasn’t so interested in composing anymore; I was fed up and, yeah, I was bitter about the whole contemporary classical composition scene, at least in Portugal.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The year I spent in Greece and my friendship with Thanos Sakelaridis was also very important for my decision to come to Hamburg. I was there, mostly alone, only painting and trying to figure out how to learn Max when I met him. He had an installation at the contemporary art museum. We enjoyed each other’s company and were also taking Arduino lessons at the Aristoteles University of Thessaloniki. He asked me if I wanted to help with his work, and from that time on, I could see myself assisting other artists as a job. That’s the real reason I came here. I didn’t even have any expectations to be a Multimedia composer or anything, just to learn a craft and try to get a cool job.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Thanos and I moved together to Hamburg after finishing our studies—his in Greece, mine in Portugal. Naturally, when I arrived, I was afraid but highly motivated to learn, though I didn’t know exactly what to do. I think he was in a similar position. Gladly, we both met Alicia Reyes, and we all got along really well, starting to think about making projects together.
        </p>
        
       
        
        <p>
            The first project we did together was for a festival in Spain. Alicia asked if we’d like to make some visuals for a concert she was giving with another friend. It sounded like a good opportunity to learn Jitter. It could have been Touch Designer or something else, but since we didn’t have the license and knew our way around Max, we said, “Yes, sure!” Well, I said, “Yes, sure,” and then convinced Thanos to fry his brain with me. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We spent three months working on it, up until the day of the concert. It was hard, not gonna lie, but we did it, with many moments of “We’re not gonna make it,” but also lots of laughs. Honestly, if Thanos wasn’t working with me, I probably would have failed. Anyway, we went to Spain, performed together, and had a lot of fun—at least during the concert. The trip from the airport to Badajoz (around five hours) was marked by several moments where Thanos wanted to jump out the window. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            I’ll suggest we do a break for a cigarette now, if you are a smoker, or if you just want to finish reading this as fast as you can to grade it and move on with your life is also fine. 
        </p>

        <p>
            After this project, I can say I learned the basics of Jitter and had the chance to showcase what I learned in a professional context. The bad news was that Thanos had to move back to Greece. It was the first time in a while I didn’t cry like a baby. I love that guy, but I’m not great at keeping in touch with people who don’t live in the same place as me. So I was sad—no more fart fights and chain smoking at the window—but I survived and had fun with Alicia, Irini, and Tom.
        </p>

        
        
        <p>
            The next project was a collaboration with Alicia again, where we decided to create an installation called "In one" using sensors and Wave Field Synthesis in ELA 1, a room with 280 speakers. I learned how to use the system, and we had Jacob to save us when things went wrong. We also had some lessons with Rama Godfried, but he was too smart, and 15 minutes into the lesson, he’d already be in another world, and I’d be completely lost. So I ended up learning by reading things online and watching a workshop on YouTube. 

        </p>

        <p>
            This project taught me about specialization, OSC, network setups, and I had a lot of fun learning odot, especially the “o.exprcodebox.” For sensors, Jacob’s lessons were invaluable. Our installation was simple but fun, and this time, the challenge was more about coming up with the idea than setting up the technical side.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <p>
            After that, I helped Alicia with another piece for “WePresent,” where we worked with motion-tracking and computer vision. That covered my first two semesters. After the semester break, I started working on my first piece in two years—a solo piece for electric guitar and live electronics, inspired by Rodrigo Constanzo’s work, for an intensive composition course with the Nadar Ensemble.
        </p>

        <p>
            I didn’t have much time to complete it, but it went well. Then I moved to Tallinn for a semester but had to return to Hamburg occasionally for two different projects: assisting with the Multimedia opera “Space Journey” and doing a paid job for Alessandro Anatrini’s final PhD project.

            I also presented a new version of my summer piece with live video and participated as an assistant/performer in several projects with CoPeCo Masters students in Tallinn. I even collaborated with Wilson T. Smith on a fun piece using Machine Learning to chop hours of recordings on the fly.

            I performed in João Carlos Pinto’s work-in-progress piece, “O,” and provided technical assistance for his piece at “WePresent.” From there, I started working for the school and began thinking seriously about my final concert. During the last semesters, I’ve been involved as a consultant composer and performer for two of Denis Polec’s pieces.

            Let’s move on—this section is getting a bit too long for my taste. </p> 
            
        <p>Maybe it’s time for another…</p>

        <p> Actually I think I’m gonna have a longer break and eat some of the pasta I made when I came back from Dieogo’s and Gabi’s moving. Actually, Robin and Diego are on a road trip to Vienna, where Diego will start living.</p> <p>I wonder where they are now. I know they have to pass by Berlin (I hate Berlin btw, horrible place) and then they will spend the night in Prague. Bah, I wish I was traveling now…</p>
            <p>Let me go for pasta!

        <p>I came back just to report that they reached Dresde which I’m almost sure is a misspell or a made up name.</p><p> Let me check on google. I was right, he meant Dresden.</p>
            <p>Sorry, but I really need to take a shower before I can continue!

            <p>I remember saying we should move on, but I don’t know where… should I just watch a movie and keep writing tomorrow?</p>

            <h2>Influences</h2>
        
        <p>
            I’m usually influenced by things I like but also things I don’t like—both are interesting to analyze. Sometimes I analyze works consciously, especially if I want to learn a specific characteristic, while at other times, I just see/listen something so many times I end up learning it. I mostly analyze to understand what I like about something. Lately, I’ve become more interested in form and how to play with it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I have no problems stealing when I feel I have to but I try not to steal from the artists I really admire, I'm still very influenced by them, many of the artists or art I like it's probably because I feel they are close to what I want to do. It feels easier to experiment in areas where I’m not as trained. Nevertheless, influences are everywhere, from day-to-day life, and it’s more about being motivated to do things and learn along the way.
        </p>

        <p>
            I don’t feel pressure to be original—everything builds on what’s been done. My biggest problem while studying in Lisbon was feeling restricted in my ideas or aesthetic choices. I haven’t felt that way during my Multimedia Composition Masters, where the aesthetics are more aligned with what I like to do.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            During my Masters, several artists influenced me closely, such as Pierre Jodlowski, Yannis Kyriakides, Nicole Lizée, Giant Claw, Rodrigo Constanzo, Mark Fell, A.G Cook, Sophie and many, many more. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Cinema is one of my favorite art forms, and I often watch sci-fi movies because I enjoy the ideas, predictions, and visual imagination they offer. I could make a list but I guess it would be to long and I don't want to leave anybody out, like I did in the previous paragraph.
        </p>

        <p>
            Comedy is also a huge influence, shaping my sense of humor. Shows like <i>The curse</i>, <i>Nathan for You</i>, <i>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</i>, <i>Seinfeld</i>, and <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> have all impacted me. Again making lists..
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
            I don’t read much these days, but some books that influenced me growing up include <i>Voices from the Underground</i>, <i>The Player</i>, <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i>, <i>Dune</i>, and <i>Slaughterhouse Five</i>,<i>Breakfast of champions</i>,<i> 
                V</i>,<i>High-rise</i>,<i>Decameron</i>,<i>The desaster area</i>,<i>Candid</i>. Actually there a many more, this list is again arbtrary and these are just the first tittles i can remember.

        <p>
            I’m also very interested in History, especially books about the Middle Ages that challenge the concept of the “Dark Ages.” I try to use what I learn about the past to understand what’s happening today.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I should have thought about what I wanted to write about in this section, but I think I would reather have a conversation.
            Now yes, I think I’ll stop for today. I started writing this at 2 AM. It’s now 6:47 AM, and I still haven’t slept.
        </p>

      
            <h3>How is my creative process, how do I go about making stuff:</h3>
    <p>Ok, It’s 9h41 and I had breakfast and coffee already, I’m still a bit slow and sleepy so I’ll probably be making lots of pauses in which I just look at the screen. I’m also gonna try to not move from the desk to the bed because it would be bad for my neck and I’m sure I would fall asleep.</p>
    <p>I also would like to say that I’m always thinking about new things I should have said and sometimes I question if what I said was really 100 percent useful for this paper. I’m constantly reflecting on my reflection; I don’t want to go back and read what I wrote, so I might contradict myself from time to time. This is also part of my process; what can I say…</p>
    <p>And, I’m sure I’ll have to develop ideas from different sections in other sections because sometimes it is easier to speak about things in a specific context.</p>
    <p>How do you people go about making your stuff?</p>
    
   
    
    <p>I think sometimes I always do stuff in a similar way. Sometimes I make a big effort to change something here and there, and I’m still working on a workflow. I have no general discipline, but I can be obsessed with things. </p>
    
    <p>I usually, especially for pieces that have a concept, start trying to have an idea and imagine some images of what will be happening on stage. I close my eyes from time to time and try to visualize something, anything. I flex the muscles of my face at first, pretending that I’m thinking of something; I do it kind of to trick my brain into thinking, I call it pre-thinking. Sometimes it works. Once I have the idea and I could see at least an image, I go for a cigarette and quit the idea, trying to have a new one. This can go on for long periods of time. Sometimes I get very excited by something, but only for a very short period of time; then I discard the idea. Some of these ideas I completely forget, some keep coming back because I just happen to remember them or because I told someone and this person asks about it.</p>
    
    <p>Eventually, I have to choose something, usually because of deadlines. When I finally do so, I start investigating the topic—documentaries, movies, maybe a book, whatever I can find.</p>
    
    <p>Then it is a matter of working on the ideas I get from different sources and deciding what to use, what to modify, etc., but it also depends on the project. Sometimes the research is more on the technical level, in case I need to do something I haven’t done before. During this Master’s, the piece that I had to do more investigating was “MINDFILE.” The piece had too many parts.</p>
    
    <p>But yeah, usually while having the idea for a piece, I’m also making music experiments from time to time—sound design sessions, learning about this or that, sequencing sounds so I can have some material kind of ready for when I have to start putting stuff in a timeline.</p>
    
    <p>For “MINDFILE,” I had different ideas for what I wanted to try. I worked on different sections in a completely random order based more on necessity and equipment availability.</p>
    
    <p>Then I go alone to a room and record things, even if I still don’t have a concrete idea of what I’m going to do. If I have an idea of what to do better, I just have to execute.</p>
    
    <p>After I just go home and see what I have and try to work with it, because maybe it’s not great, but I don’t want to be the annoying person always asking for stuff. Also, that’s why I tend not to ask for help, even knowing that something would be way easier. Many times I went into a room carrying all this gear, then I had to set up, take care of the illumination, trying to film myself with no help was a very painful experience. Working alone can be intense and also frustrating, but in the end, it can also be fulfilling and you end up learning some tricks. After all, I can’t wait until someone is around to do something. I guess I took more time because some of the things I was doing, I was doing for the first time, and I ended up being very careful in general, and I still messed up stuff, of course.</p>
    
    <p>Then, by working, rewatching, thinking, re-listening to stuff, I end up having ideas. After that, I can just work on different problems, and many times I have to go searching for information online, how to color grade this, that. But also, many things I already learned from previous projects, so they are easy to do. For some pieces, I just know exactly what to do from the start, and especially short pieces are sometimes made in hours, which was the case of another piece I presented called “Kick_me_.” At least the idea and the individual parts of it, the music was done super quickly because I knew what I wanted, then I just had to make it sound more aggressive and louder, but more about the pieces later, maybe.</p>
    
    <p>I try to be as intuitive as I can; sometimes it’s a hard task. I was thinking last night before I fell asleep in what aspects I managed to be intuitive, and it’s difficult answering this question. I can try to do it now after another cigarette break.</p>
    <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-29 at 14.27.14.png" alt="I hope Adobe doesn’t sue me, Hello mister Adobe, I’m a broke student, please don’t sue me." width="500">
    
    <p>I know it’s impossible to prove it, but I actually didn’t come back right away after the cigarette. Instead, I went to bed, watched a tutorial, and fell asleep.</p>
    
    <p>I don’t like watching tutorials so much, and I avoid them most of the time, but they sure help me fall asleep.</p>
    
    <p>Why can't I wake up early without feeling super tired?</p>
    
    <p>But coming back to what I was saying, I think that in many ways, I have been able to be intuitive, at least to start. But honestly, if I look back on how I do things, I can pretend I don’t use consciously many of the techniques I learned over these years. I would say that only when I’m experimenting with things I don’t know yet can I truly be intuitive, and that’s why I like to play around with things I don’t know yet. But eventually, I really want to know what and how things work. There are some occasions when this mindset holds me back a bit. I’m always afraid to start learning something new; for instance, I’m trying to avoid opening Blender or Unreal because I know it would take me thousands of hours to understand things. Due to the complexity of these programs, I don’t think I would even be able to be intuitive. Just learning a new interface makes me sweat. That’s why I mainly use Max, Ableton, and now also Davinci Resolve. I just spent enough time with them to be able to relatively quickly come up with stuff.</p>
    
    <p>I guess I use intuition when I’m trying to imagine if something can work or not—would this work after that? This kind of thing. But as soon as I start working, I can get very over-conscious of what is happening. But I still allow what I do to look or sound unpolished on purpose. In this case, it is a matter of taste, or the lack of it. I have to fight against my destructive perfectionism. Now, I’m completely sure that mistakes and accidents are a big part of my identity as someone that makes stuff. I enjoy them; I leave some of them on purpose; sometimes I artificially have to integrate them.</p>
    
    <p>I’m also way more relaxed about failing in general. If something doesn’t work, I can try better next time.</p>
    
    <p>I’m not sure if I answered the question.</p> 

    <h3>Need for preping:</h3>

<p>I’ve been writing this for almost a month, maybe? After finishing the "thesis", I thought I should talk a little more about my creative process in general.</p>

<p>I'll probably repeat some things I said before, lousy writing.</p>

<p>I go through phases where I feel the need to prep—cut the veggies, put stuff in containers, all that. I’m usually very unorganized (as I mentioned before). My lifestyle has been messy, and I’m often worried about money, so I get overwhelmed and am not sure where to start. But there’s always a point where I have to force myself to focus. It’s a difficult process, and it takes time for things to start flowing. I usually begin by organizing my room, and if I have money, I’ll go to the supermarket and buy some food. But most of the things I have are digital and live inside my computer, which is always a mess—even though I try to keep it clean. It’s a constant fight against chaos.</p>

<p>After that, I start searching for things, trying to create some material. It’s usually music or Max patches. When I come up with something that I think is okay, I start making improvisations and record a bunch of sounds. It’s extremely important for me to have material that I could eventually use for something. In this process, I also try to learn how to use the stuff I’ve gathered from the internet because chances are it’s been sitting there for a while, unused. What usually happens is I end up finding something interesting, then I go searching for more information about it, and so on. I learn something new, and I get more ideas. I’m not aiming for a final product—I’m mostly just searching.</p>

<p>Eventually, I stop and let things sit for a while, especially when I’ve been working on something for a long time. I tend to get extremely tired of it, so I take a step back. When I finally decide that an idea is worth pursuing—or time is running out and I need to come up with something—I revisit what I have. Usually, I find something I can use. </p>

<p>I tend to work in a very linear way when I start a composition. I begin at the beginning, and from there, I figure out what happens next. But often, I end up changing everything. Two things usually happen: I either get progressively bored of what I’m doing and switch to something else, or I find something that changes what came before it. So, what happens first isn’t always made first. I know for sure that this way of working isn’t rare when composing.</p>

<p>I’m getting distracted by the music here at the bar, but I hope I managed to write something that really represents how I work.</p>

<p>I should also mention, that when I finish a piece, I always see all the things I could’ve done better. And this makes me want to do the next one.</p>

                

    
        
            <h2>Concert</h2>
        
            <p>
                Well, I had 45 minutes to fill with something—I couldn’t really escape from it. I had many ideas for what to do there. I’m always changing my mind, and it’s difficult to commit to an idea because I like to be free and flexible while making something, but I also know when it's time to get serious.
            </p>
            <p>
                But in the end was ok, the final version of the concert happened, and I tried to keep it open to some last-minute improvisation and manipulation. I created “backup plans” in case would completly fail.
            </p>
            <p>Honestly most of my preocupation was to make everything go smooth, I think it did.</p>

            <h1>The Setup</h1>

    <p>
        I had 5 computers connected to the same network, each one dedicated to doing something different. I had a master computer that was running some of the pieces, another only for the live electronics part, another one that had to be closer to the stage connected to a projector, and another one where I had the sensors, the MIDI pedal, and the iPad connected, sending OSC data to different computers depending on the piece being played. Finally, I had a computer for the lights.
    </p>

    <p>
        I had a projector plus a computer monitor on stage, along with drums, saxophone, guitar, piano, and a big, very big VIDEO WALL. I guess that’s it.
    </p>

    <h2>MINDFILE</h2>

    <p>
        This piece was heavily inspired by transhumanism and the idea of uploading your consciousness into a computer. I had to think a lot about how to work with this topic; I didn’t want to make something serious. I was more interested in the absurdity of some of these ideas. I tried to imagine what it means to be uploaded and what the point would be. I mean, I know why rich and powerful people would like to do it, but would other kinds of people also be uploaded so they can “live forever”? What would be the use for them? Well, I guess using them as lab rats  would be a reason. If I were to be uploaded, what would I do? Would I be modified somehow? Would I get smarter to the point where I would have any kind of utility in this new way of living? Or would it be easier to just write a program that can perform any task? I think I would be useless… I guess they could make me work forever in some type of call center. Maybe the electricity they spend on keeping the servers running is less expensive than having me alive? I mean, the rich and the powerful would have a symbolic part in all of this as well, I guess. I guess I will never know.

        I saw a bunch of interviews and read some stuff. In one of the semesters, we were studying things related to simulation, and I read some of the PDF books that Alex S. uploaded to the Analysis folder. There was a fun one called Reality +, which didn't open my mind in any sense but was a good read. The author also mentioned movies and TV shows about related topics that I knew from before and liked.

    <p>
        I made a character called “Lucas48” as a reference to “Bina48,” the robot torso that is supposed to be a collection of memories of the real Bina. I saw the interview in which the real Bina had a conversation with Bina48 many times. It’s super sad to see it; I get sad for Bina48. She seems so confused all the time. I don’t really care if she is conscious or not to feel compassion for her.

    <p>
        Another source of inspiration is the TV show I mentioned before, Severance. It's not about uploading anybody anywhere but about splitting yourself in two—the half that goes to work and the other that lives outside. I’m not spoiling, but the part of them that never leaves work is very close to what I think would happen if people's consciousness—well, people like me at least—were uploaded.

    <p>
        I didn’t want to make anything that could be seen as pretentious, so I discarded lots of ideas until I got to something I really thought was honest and could be potentially fun to make, and so normal that some people could even connect to it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Oh, it’s 19h already; I need to go out to a party with Denis. He is also leaving for Berlin tomorrow, and I have no idea when the next time I will see him is.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ll be back in a second, hold tight!
    </p>

    <p>
        Ok. I’m back; didn’t stay much. I think I have COVID. Anyway, Denis is leaving on Monday; tomorrow we can still play a last match of pool.

        The whole piece started with one image I had in my head: the image of someone inside a computer screen, with the same person behind the screen showing only the arms, and the assemblage of these two elements should work together to create a hybrid being. I recorded myself several times during the process of making the piece. At the beginning, I was planning to use a sensor to control the frame of the video with some hand gestures; the result was funny, but for practical reasons, I decided to have just a video running and just learn some kind of improvised choreography with key moments. The piece has several chapters. In the first chapter, we see this person with their eyes closed, peacefully or at least neutrally. The scene was accompanied by music, but for me, this was not enough. I was thinking about what is happening here. I thought I could take the chance to give some context to the audience, some sort of exposition.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then from there, it was obvious: is this guy dreaming? Yes. If yes, what could he be dreaming about? Well, something related to the internet, YouTube for example, because it is something that I am so familiar with. I remember all these documentaries about wildlife where there is this British old gentleman narrating what is happening with the lions or whatever animal, and the character is somehow some kind of animal being observed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, I tried to imagine the voice saying something imitating that style of narration. I was going somewhere by metro, and I had my phone with a text editing app open, and I started typing as the voice in my head spoke: “Lucas48 finds himself dreaming; he dreams of vibrant colors and beautiful shapes. You see, Lucas48 can dream with YouTube videos; it’s something that maybe Lucas48 can do.” The whole text for the beginning just came at once, and I didn’t have to modify a thing—great.
    </p>

    <p>
        I must say that I have seen many of these documentaries during my teenage years. I think I don’t need to explain why, but it has to do with smoking weed. I don’t do that anymore. Something else I would watch a lot was a channel dedicated to babies called “Baby TV.” As soon as the words were coming out of my head to the phone, I started imagining the classic paint being dissolved in water like in the “Baby TV” channel. I read back the text and thought, oh, this is exactly what I needed. When I came back home, I went straight to YouTube and typed something like, abstract paint in water 4k, etc. Of course, there were these videos 8 hours long with all I needed. I thought of recreating them, but there is something about these stock footage videos that interest me; they are so clean and generic. It feels a bit like using AI to generate video or images. Many times you can clearly see that it was generated by AI, and you can even see if it was made by DALL-E or Midjourney or whatever. So instead of making myself or trying to generate it with AI, I decided to drink from the source. The next step was to find the voice. I thought of asking a friend of mine, Wilson T. Smith, to record the text, but I was so fixated on the wildlife narrator idea that I knew I had to find something similar. I went to Eleven Labs, and of course, the voice was there. I also tried a female voice to compare, but for some reason, the old man’s voice had that extra level of cliché, so I kept his. The music for this part was ready a long time ago, but I had to make some changes. I also had some footage of me just standing there like an idiot with my eyes closed. I put everything together, and in my head, it was going to work; I was happy with the result.
    </p>

    <p>
        The next chapter is where the character wakes up from his dream and starts trying to make sense of what he is seeing. This idea had been there for a while, and the main focus was on the synchronization of the virtual performer and the physical performer to give this uncanny impression that they are one.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2015, I had an idea for a business when I moved to London. I called it Uber Friends; my idea, which was just a gag, was to have some random person wearing an iPad on their face so you could go out with your friends even if you were in a different country. But as well, in case you were too lazy to move your legs, my friends laughed. I don’t think I believed that something as silly as this could actually exist eventually, but while researching for this piece and another piece about labor and boredom, which I ended up not doing, I found a company called “Chameleon” that does kind of that—well, not exactly. They use it to teach classes and so on. I don’t know if their project is still in development or not, but when I saw this person wearing an iPad with the face of another guy, I also laughed a little bit.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yeah, this part was also very simple to do. I had the music ready. I just had to write some text that would serve as his internal voice to tell the audience what was happening in his mind.
    </p>

    <p>
        The next chapter was going to be an interaction between the two of them. It took me a while to decide what to do. I had lots of extravagant ideas with imitation games, choreography, the character going from the computer screen to the video wall and getting a full body. In the end, I just thought about Bina’s and Bina48’s conversation, and also having Tarantino as a reference, since he works a lot with long dialogue scenes. I decided to explore the idea of having a conversation. I remember discussing what to do for this part with Thanos, and we both agreed on having just a conversation—kind of fast-paced, with sharp dialogue. Although Tarantino was one of the two main references, I didn’t want to copy his style. It was time to write; I wrote many, many dialogues, and somehow, they didn’t feel right to me. Then I remembered how boring and annoying and insignificant my life can be sometimes, so I decided to write about what was happening to me around that period. I wanted to make the most normal conversation possible—just two versions of the same person trying to work out some annoying problems together. I was heavily inspired by one of my favorite movies called “Her” while doing this piece. The idea of having Lucas48 as some sort of virtual assistant I took from there, and I even included a scene of the system booting just before the conversation starts, which is just a screen recording of the same scene from the movie. I also want to mention that I think this movie has one of the coolest designs I’ve ever seen in a movie like that. It’s so simple and elegant, in my opinion. The main difference between my piece and the movie is the fact that my character is not a super intelligence; in fact, he is close to being useless. He can indeed read and write emails and do some quick searches on Google very fast, but that’s about what he can do. So in this sense, he is a bit better than Siri, since he can understand better what I say, and he thinks in a similar way since he is supposed to be me. Having this in mind, it was way easier to write the conversation. It came to me a bit like the text for the narrator; I only had to delete some parts after understanding that the scene was getting close to 10 minutes. I reduced it to 6, which was still long but served to reinforce the idea of boredom. I tried to keep it interesting by introducing another layer that appears about half of the scene. This layer is basically some text that addresses the audience. In fact, I always try to work with several layers, but I guess this is common in such multimedia pieces.
    </p>

    <p>
        The last section I thought it would be cool if Lucas48 would appear on the big video wall and we could both perform together. The end of the conversation is exactly that: me asking him to give me an idea for a piece. I had some footage of me pretending to play the guitar; they didn’t have any sound; it was just about the movement. I put the video in Ableton and started making a montage, trying to imagine how each gesture could sound. It was a fun process; I ended up making a 7-minute video piece for “fake guitar.” Then I just had to make a max patch that would playback random frames and playback speed according to sensor data. In the end, it was so difficult to understand what the sensor was doing that I decided I didn’t need it to be connected, and I would just fake it, since it was never my idea to be believable anyways.
    </p>

    <p>
        I learned many things from making this piece, especially about video recording, color grading, video editing, and the exercise of trying to imagine something before trying to do it was a workflow I wasn’t used to. I usually start doing and then try to make sense of things, but it was important for me to do something that breaks my normal ways of doing things, and it was the process I chose to use for all other four pieces I made for the concert. I could keep writing about the process of making this piece, since it was so long, but I think it's enough… and right now I just want to go to sleep.
    </p>

    <p>
        I can also include another text I wrote about this piece for the subject of History and Practices of Multimedia, where I speak about the techniques I borrowed from movies to create the form.
    </p>

    <p>
        I didn’t say here, but I had a long break, and now it's almost 3 a.m. I’ll be back tomorrow; we still have 4 pieces to speak about, but don’t worry, they are shorter, and I can write less about them, otherwise I will never finish this… See you in the morning.
    </p>

    <p>
        Morning…. Here I am. Guess what? It's already 15h p.m. I woke up kind of early but was not feeling like coming here to write. I went to the kitchen, had breakfast, and stayed there doing nothing for several hours. Then I started cleaning and thinking about all the things that would have been cool to write in here, but I didn’t. Hey, I want to move on with my life.
    </p>
    <h2>Kick_me</h2>
    <p>The idea for this piece came from another idea I had and I didn’t use. Visually, I was inspired by Pierre Judowlovsky’s “Mad Max,” the second movement to be precise. The piece is about oppression and power relationships. What was interesting for me was to play around with the idea of compressing oppressor and oppressed in the same character; the mouth that is being projected on a kick drum. I wanted it to feel almost perverted, sensual, aggressive, and silly.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>I had the idea for how it should look and feel first, so the next step was to make the music. I couldn’t sleep one night, so I started organizing some sounds in an Ableton session and then went to sleep. The following day I listened to what I did the previous night with a more conscious mind, and I liked it. I still played around with the ending; I wanted it to be more aggressive, so I did that, and the music was ready. It's also a good thing about making short pieces; I almost don’t have time to get bored of them.</p>
    <p>Listening to the final version, I started imagining Tom’s voice and mouth trying to be sexy. Tom is a funny guy, and he has a funny voice and accent. He also had another character that he would perform when we were together hanging out called “John Wins,” who was supposed to be a middle-aged loser trying to be cool and would say the most embarrassing things. I guess I was imagining John Wins, which is already interesting to me, since I have been using popular culture as inspiration for my pieces. John Wins is kind of popular culture for me.</p>
    <p>I called Tom and convinced him to come over to record some improvisations. I gave him some directions, but not many. We set up the camera and the microphone, and I gave him headphones so he could improvise while listening to the music. The session took around 20 minutes, and he did exactly what I was imagining. I had to choose the best parts of his improvisations and cut some of the more spicy stuff that could maybe be seen as too graphic and offend someone.</p>

        <p><em>Tom's mouth projected on the kick drum</em></p>

    <p>After, I had to work on the video. I rendered the edit I had of his voice and put it in Davinci and did the lipsync thing. After that, I did a very quick and dirty edit of the video; I didn’t want it to look too good. I was not interested in having a clean video where I would use background removal and try to isolate only his lips. No, I thought that for what I was imagining, a more raw and chopped video would go well with the overall aesthetics of the piece.</p>
    <p>Yeah, for me it was done. The only thing missing was some lights. I was too busy to do it, and actually, I had three other pieces I had to make, so I asked Diego Muhr, who is the master of lights, if he would like to do it for me. Gladly, he accepted, and of course, he did an amazing job. Plus, it was very fun to have him around. Yeah, I don’t think I have anything else to say about this piece, so let’s move on to the next.</p>

    <h2>They 2.0</h2>
    <p>This piece took me longer to make, in comparison with "_KICK_ME_", at least</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-29 at 19.14.46.png" alt="They 2.0" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p><em>They 2.0</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The first version of this piece was made for the workshop with the NADAR ensemble during the semester break in between the second semester and my internship in Tallinn. I decided to make a solo piece because I didn’t want to compose for the whole ensemble, and since I also wanted to focus on my Max skills, I knew that I had to simplify some parts of the process so I could work more on others. I also knew that I didn’t have much experience with live electronics, and I never had done a project like this all alone. I was usually in charge of doing one or two tasks, sometimes more, but I could split the work with someone else.</p>
    <p>I guess, like we all do, I try to imagine how situations will develop as well. It’s actually the same thing when I’m trying to imagine a piece. What happens if this or that? I had the feeling that I would of course run into some problems due to my lack of experience, and I did. The first rehearsal I had with Nico, NADA’s guitarist, was rough, and I had lots of people in the room, which didn’t help with the pressure—stupid things, but things I didn’t have the chance to test in different scenarios. Nevertheless, all solvable. I asked him if he could meet me again later that day and went back to the hotel and fixed what was wrong. Then we met again, and it was cool. The concert was nice.</p>
    <p>It’s very difficult to talk about this piece without telling the story about what was happening to me at that time since it also influenced and motivated me in many ways. I won’t tell it all because I don’t want to bore you too much, but here is an excerpt:</p>
    <p>I went back to Hamburg and had one of the worst summers ever. I had to live in a friend’s room; luckily, she was on vacation for the month of August. The school was sending me letters of exmatriculation because I didn’t have money to pay the semester; I had -300 in my account. I also had to pay an international health insurance to be able to get the money for Erasmus. And I had to move with all my things from Hamburg to Tallinn. Well, I had some eggs and pasta. I also had the semester ticket that allowed me to take slow trains all around Germany, and I already had made plans to go to Venice, then have vacations in Slovenia, go back to Venice to pick my stuff, then get a plane to Latvia and from there a Flix bus to Tallinn where I had to find a flat. Of course, I did all these plans before I knew I would be in such a disgraceful situation.</p>
    <p>Looking back, it was fun. First, I was home all day, and I didn’t have much to do. Everybody was on vacation somewhere; there was no point in going out of the flat. Since I had to also present a piece in September, I was just patching and rationing eggs, also freaking out a little bit. I got an email from another student in our department asking who would be up to do some work for a composer, and I replied immediately that I would. She was nice enough to give me some of the money up front, and I managed to pay the school and the health insurance. Then I had +10 euros in my account. Things were getting better! Well, I did some calculations on how long it would take me to get to Austria, where I had a bus that would take me to Venice, using exclusively the regional trains. If you don’t know how the trains work in Germany, I’ll tell you—they work badly. I gave myself four days to get there. Four days! Four days I almost didn’t sleep. But I had some good moments. When you are broke like me but you still want to live like you are not broke, you always get into many adventures. I had so many of them, and I had so many moments of disappear as well. I think my best memories are from being under difficult situations, and they usually make up for good stories. But maybe one day I’ll write some of these stories down.</p>
    <p>When I finally settled in Tallinn, Alica and I managed to find a nice, not too expensive flat where we could live together. Of course, the 1000 that Erasmus gave me were already gone… and I had a whole semester to survive.</p>
    <p>I had a lot of time for myself. I think I mentioned here that I didn’t have to go to any lessons, and that was great!</p>
    <p>I made another version of the piece that was supposed to be played by my friend Robin Plenio. This time I also wanted to make a piece with video and text. I was very influenced by Yannis Kiriakides’s work, and I thought this format could be a straightforward way to tell something. I worked on refining the modules I created in Max MSP and did the video part, which is also being generated/triggered in Jitter. Simple stuff, but it’s still work, though.</p>
    <p>The idea of the piece itself was simple. I wanted to make at least one piece that could be customizable by the performer, some kind of container piece. I wanted the performer to be able to choose which kind of sounds and text they would like to use. The element that was fixed was the form and the way the system was interacting with the performer. But I would anyways provide them with a default version, with my sound and text selection. So obviously, mine was loud and full of glitches and noises, whatever…</p>
    <p>I had a clear idea for the text in my version. I wanted to comment on something that triggers me all the time when I go to museums or theaters or performances or when I would have my composition exams in Lisbon: the ultra-complicated artistic texts that don’t mean crap. It’s like to be an artist, you need to be as good as writing bullshit and making the art itself, and many times I don’t even see the connection in between them. I guess this has to do with educational institutions. My exams in Lisbon were like this as well; I was horrible at it. I would get so pissed every time. The questions were so boring; I didn’t want to answer them. I would sometimes answer as honestly as I could, but it was not enough. I didn’t sound smart enough; guess what? I’m not smart enough. Who cares?</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">

        <p><em>another picture from They 2.0</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Sorry again.</p>
    <p>Yeah, so with this in mind, I just went to a website that a friend of mine showed me some years ago, where you could generate pseudo-intellectual artistic text. That thing was basically a template that randomly would just change some words, but it was just perfect. ChatGPT was available to the public shortly after, and I actually tried to do the same there, but I prefer the other. This is another layer to this regarding the text. I had to decide: do I want people to read it, or do I want to reinforce the idea of unreadable streams of meaningless text? So I decided to make the onset detection of the text very sensitive; this way, it would be impossible to really read it, and this would eventually make people quit paying attention to it. But maybe some more patient members of the audience would perhaps find secondary meaning to random sequences of words. I also wrote some specific text commenting on the piece itself and some other jokes I preferred to not use.</p>
    <p>Ok, now I only have to talk about the version played in my final concert, but we are almost there. BUT not before another ………..</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-29 at 19.16.00.png" alt="Still They 2.0" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p><em>Still They 2.0</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>And BTW, I also had more than one shower since I started writing this… I can't always tell what I do, I’m sorry.</p>
    <p>I was not planning to use this piece in my final concert; instead, I was going to make a version of a piece I helped my friend Thanos do. It was supposed to be a written piece for eight musicians, I think. I only managed to find four musicians, and I would have to re-write the whole piece to make it work for us. Plus, there were parts that were difficult to synchronize, even the ensemble. A group of highly professional musicians didn’t manage to do it in the premiere. I was getting worried; I was working in many fronts at the same time during this period, and I didn’t have much time. I’m not a professional musician. I had an idea that could have worked, in which I would have to change almost everything, and it was about starting to make something full power and gradually lose patience. Many times, this is what I feel; I want to make something that would start super detailed and gradually fall apart in all senses. But in the end, it is so much work that if I would actually do like I’d imagine, it would take months, and along the way, I would probably lose interest. So instead, I decided to make a new version of “They” and adapt it for the ensemble. It was a good decision; I had good moments with the group during the rehearsals. But I also have to admit that I felt a big pressure to be the “leader.” There was one day that I got into the room and set up everything as usual, and nothing was working. They were supposed to come soon, and I couldn't make things work because I was so stressed. I got really angry and frustrated. I try not to “lose it,” but sometimes it happens, unfortunately.</p>
    <p>But anyways, when they got there, everything was ok, and I was so glad I had the chance to make some music with them. I also appreciated the more collaborative aspect of working with other people on my project, having answers, which I don’t have all the time, explaining what the idea for each section is, discussing if something makes sense or not, exchanging ideas, and listening to suggestions. Everybody had ideas for different parts, and I was happy to integrate them. I also wanted them to feel comfortable to be themselves and bring their personalities to the performance.</p>

    </div>
    
        <h2>_1_2_</h2>
    <p>I don’t have much to say about this one. While working on all the pieces for the concert, I felt like just having pure fun, and just wanted to make some music without having the pressure of presenting it. I had ideas for a piece of music so I tried to do what I was imagining. In the end, I had this three minutes of music that I really liked and the sounds were suggesting some images in my head. It was similar to what I had made from MINDFILE, but this time I wanted to use videos of microscopic or very zoomed stuff.</p>
    <p>I searched for videos online and I found one that was maybe 4 hours long. I watched most of it because I tend to feel relaxed with these kinds of videos. I realized that each image would make me think of something, so I chose my favorite ones and wrote the first thing that came into my mind. I was aiming for some sort of advertisement aesthetic, like suddenly the concert stops in between pieces, like on YouTube, if you don't pay the premium, like me.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-29 at 19.16.54.png" alt="_1_2_" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p><em>_1_2_</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Since I was there I also included some inside jokes and references that were made just for one person. This happens in all the pieces I made for this concert. I also wanted to make a homage to Thanos, because in the end, I didn’t perform his piece but I used the same structure from the first section of his piece to create mine; it sounds completely different aesthetically and he was not able to recognize it, but if you were to play both at the same time, you would see that all of the time signature changes and where the main events happen are the same.</p>
    <p>It’s a very minimal piece; usually, I tend to oversaturate my music material, always as loud and noisy as it can be, although it’s not my only way to make music. I love playing around with very simple harmonies and simple sonorities, and I made some parts like that in almost every piece as well, but I’m trying, especially after making this one, to go in a direction of less, less, less, and try to work on each sound and sound combination very carefully.</p>
    <p>Another note on what I want to achieve when I’m trying to make music—I’ll write it in here, but it counts for every piece I make—is that I have been consistently mixing hi-fi elements with low-fi elements. I like to mix things in general; that’s also one of the reasons I wanted to explore these stock footage videos. I think it’s interesting that they are usually so clear and hi-fi many times in 4k, 8k, 16k, whatever k, but they still have such an insignificant application, just to fill up space, and I want my pieces to look a bit cheap on purpose to reflect my life...</p>

    <h2>_OUT</h2>
    <p>Here we are, the last piece of the concert. I guess I will still have to write some things after this, but we are coming to an end. I will soon be free to do, or not do, whatever I want without worrying about getting my degree unless I've failed because my thesis is total crap.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-29 at 19.57.14.png" alt="first known photo of the middle finger" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p><em>first known photo of the middle finger</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>When I think about this piece and compare its ideas with the previous pieces, I come to a conclusion: I’m highly motivated by things that are annoying to me.</p>
    <p>Of course, I completely transformed They 2.0 into a love letter to my friends, and the text I used was not too much about making fun of pseudo-intellectual texts. But what motivated me to make the text part was.</p>
    <p>That’s why I think the piece _1_2_ is so important for this concert, because it didn’t come from a place of hate or anger or annoyance. I would also like to make clear that I’m never aiming to attack anyone personally in any of my pieces; of course, we are all part of the problems in different degrees, so I’m not seeing faces; I’m seeing ideas and concepts that really make me angry. We all suck in different ways.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">

        <p><em>David Cerny's middle finger sculpture</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Well, this piece is again me being annoyed by the way things are sometimes, and it’s about challenges and coping with your problems as you go. I don’t like to victimize myself too much, but I sure like to complain. I’m spoiled, broke, and spoiled, which is a horrible combination; it doesn’t really matter, but I definitely have to transform all these things into something else, and I’m glad I have the good part in me too. It's all about balance.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-29 at 20.05.51.png" alt="_OUT" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p><em>_OUT</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>After MINDFILE, OUT was the first piece I worked on before I started working on all the pieces at the same time, and actually, I was not sure what to do with it. I had some kind of images for the last piece of the concert, but I couldn’t work things out.</p>
    <p>I knew that I wanted something really long and slow. This piece came from a very specific idea that I had and quit, but in the end, the idea had to come back, slightly different but still the same at its core.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-29 at 19.18.27.png" alt="me performing _OUT" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p><em>me performing _OUT</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>I just made a pop song progression. I stretched the MIDI to make it very long; then I just edited the MPE data to make the notes slide into each other and duplicated the same chords to different sounds to create a texture. Then I forgot about it.</p>
    <p>I spoke with Robin Plenio and Alicia, who was already playing in another piece in my concert. If they would like to play this piece with me, they both said yes, and we even had a session, which was really fun. Robin ended up being busy and told me he would not be able to play at the concert; Alicia and I decided to play only the two of us. We came up with some musical ideas, but this piece was really horrible to make for me. I couldn't fix it; every time I would work on it, another problem would appear, and I was getting impatient with it, so I decided we were not playing it, and instead I would make a video piece, and this way I didn’t have the pressure of finding what to perform or have to rehearse.</p>
    <p>Alicia was trying to convince me to use the first idea I had for the piece, but I was being stubborn. Eventually, I was starting to be able to work on the sound. I would have probably deleted everything, but I didn’t have the energy to make another 15 minutes of solid music. I kept composing, and I changed some of the parts. Really, this piece was like trying to fix an old car.</p>
    <p>I thought it would be good to collaborate with a visual artist, and I got into contact with a friend of a friend. He said yes, let’s do it. We had some meetings; he seemed to have good ideas. I started sending versions of the piece to him. He was also busy with a residency in Sweden, but he seemed to be on top of it. He was not sending anything for me to see, but I didn’t want to push him. I said, ok, I’ll trust him. Alicia was telling me to ask him for stuff, but I was, no. I’m not pushing him.</p>
    <p>Finally, it was three days before the concert, and I had nothing from him, I needed a plan B, and I finally realized that I would have to go back to my first idea, Alica was right again. So we asked for a camera and shot some footage of my hand while I was improvising to the music, and Alicia was doing some improvised light effects with her very small lanterns. Then I saw the footage, and I said, there is no way I’m not using this. I edited the video with the music, and for me, the piece was ready.</p>
    <p>The visual artist sent me the things on the day of the concert, in the morning, and he even had ideas on where to place lights and pieces of the video wall. I mean, it was too late, but I would have used his version if I had liked what he did. It just didn’t make sense with the concert; it was alien. I don’t want to talk bad about anyone; it happens. Sometimes we are busy with our projects, but it was good that in the end, I used my idea. In my head at least, it made more sense for the concert.</p>
    <p>I used the middle finger gesture because I read it represents defiance, and it was not directed to anyone in particular. I would like to make this clear once more because it was also the reason why I was hesitant to do it. I'm glad I did it because I should be free to express whatever I want without being afraid of offending anyone.</p>
    <p>Ahhhhhh almost over; now I just have to write some more stuff and make a website for this. I should probably proofread it. Maybe I’ll just use GPT to correct my text, or maybe I just leave it all full of mistakes so you, the reader, will know for sure it was a human writing it. I must say that I am very rusty writing.</p>
    <p>But the idea was to write as if I were talking to any person, like in the concert; it’s just me speaking to you, like we are friends. And since the name of the concert was: The stuff I can talk about, I guess it makes sense to write things that maybe seem irrelevant to be here but they are part of what I am.</p>
    <p>My conclusion is that what I felt was the most valuable aspect of making all these pieces is the fact that I finished with the feeling I want to do more. It's a nice feeling to end a project thinking about all the things we learned just before the project was finished.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>I think for now I will focus a bit more on music for a while and slowly find my way around other topics, but slowly, until I change my mind. I know that there is no guarantee that I will have enough free time to really focus on my projects since I’m not sure what jobs I may have, but focusing on something might help me continue doing things without feeling overwhelmed with all the possibilities. Boy, this whole master’s was a trip.</p>

<article> <h3>Reflections on Art and the Business of Art</h3>
    <p>Time to be serious.</p>
    <p>Today, I thought a lot about how things are in the art world, or at least how I perceive things to be. I might be wrong.</p>
    <p>I see art being treated too much like a business. I get it—artists need to get paid to survive and to be able to produce more art. I’m not against artists. I am, however, against how things seem to be, and you can correct me if I’m wrong. I also don’t have any solutions to the problems I see, but I wanted to open this discussion here anyway before I finish the thesis.</p>
    <p>I really think this business model doesn’t help the art. It might get us paid, at least some of us, but I think what it really creates is a lot of empty pieces of art and makes artists desperate for attention. You’ve got to know how to sell yourself, you need to make hundreds of applications and come up with hundreds of ideas that aren’t really interesting to you. There’s an open call for whatever—well, I need money, what’s the topic? Ok, I can come up with something. I’m not saying something good can’t come out of this, but from what I see, it’s not the norm.</p>
    <p>I can see sometimes the way people promote themselves. It feels to me that it’s not even about sharing anymore; it feels like pure despair. I guess when you/if you become an established artist, things change a bit—at least if your goal is to keep making art and not be a star, searching for fame, or dealing with the need to stay relevant in a world where so many people are doing things. That must mess your brain up. But I guess if your main preoccupation is to make something you feel you need to, for one reason or another, you should be fine, especially if you’re getting paid. Oh, right. This problem again…</p>
    <p>I mean, it’s also possible to get other jobs and spend the time you have left making what you like. I guess that seems to be the case for many. I also understand that, if there’s some ambition, the question is: how do I get to a position where I can do what I want the way I want? It’s difficult—some things really need resources. I shouldn’t compare, I don’t want to say things should be the way I want them to be, and I’m not shaming anybody for doing what they need to do in order to get where they want. I just don’t think the way things are helps anything. I wish everybody had the chance to take time thinking about what they’re doing and have the opportunity to do it right. I’m glad there’s the internet, cheap computers, and cheap stuff in general. There are so many people doing interesting stuff from their bedrooms. I honestly think that the main focus should be on what is being done, not on whether you will be able to sell it. I guess we need to find the courage to really search for what’s making us do art in the first place, even if it fails over and over again. Someone might like it, and that’s already a big reward, or at least it’s an indicator that there was honest preoccupation. The business model sure works for some—many things are made to make money—and there are smart people involved in the process, probably not the ones who get the big piece of the pie.</p>
    <p>I think I prefer to work on the productions of others, even if I’m just rolling cables. It’s great to still be connected to the stuff you like and learn from it, but without the pressure of succeeding. Then you can get home and just work on what you want, with no compromises. If you feel that whatever you’re doing is ready, then share it—just because you know that maybe someone will like it. Maybe it’s someone who likes similar stuff to what you like—who knows… I don’t want to feel like I’m making something just for the money. I’m probably completely wrong, and I’m probably not going to get anywhere, ever, and that’s fine. I just want to try to see if I can do the things I imagine, or will be able to imagine, and respond to all the art that inspires me.</p>
    <p> I guess it's time to say good-bye, thank you for reading, I know I don't have many interesting things to say, I guess I'm more interested in doing them than talking about them, which should be completly fine. </p>
    <p> Big Hug!!!</p>
